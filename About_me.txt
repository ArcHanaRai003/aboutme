Hello! My name is Archana Rai. I am from Nepal. I am a first year IT student in Ulsan College. 
I am taking this course to know more about the technology in depth. Till last semester I was afraid whether i can understand it or not.
But slowly I am beginning to learn it. I hope it's not too late to start at this point.
